# Ergodicity and Infotaxis

### Ergodic Measurement
Calculates the ergodicity of a provided trajectory. The code loops through various values of b in an A matrix, generating new trajectories, and calculates the ergodicity of each.

### Infotaxis
Applies method of infotaxis to allow a given object to found a source (door) in an enclosed area.
