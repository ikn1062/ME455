# Particle and Kalman Filters

Particle filters:
* A particle filter was implemented to estimate the positon of an object moving along a trajectory with observations and control signals that produce noise

Kalman Filter:
* A kalman filter was implemented based on Wikipedia's algorithm, used to estimate the position of a trajectory with control and positional noise.
